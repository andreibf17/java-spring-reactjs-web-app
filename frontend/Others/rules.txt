Structuring rules:

- A component can define nested components or services. It cannot use or define scenes.
- A scene can define nested components, scenes or services.
- A service can define nested services. It cannot use or define components or scenes.
- Nested features can only use from its parent.

Components defined at the root level of your project, in the components folder, are global and can be used anywhere in your application. But if you decide to define a new component inside another component (nesting), this new component can only be used its direct parent.
